It worked for my ios 13.4.1 iPhone and I bet it will work for other versions too.

Unfortunately this software is limited to the photos and videos!
I am happy to help you by email: blxyon@yahoo.com to extract any of your data from an unecrypted iPhone/iPad backup.
I am quick with my emails so do not worry.
You only got to change the destination variables specifically for your computer!

You must also be careful with the filenames! Otherwise the console will give you an error. I advise you to change in the os.rename to make it a file name distinguished than the ones you already put in. For exammple you would like to insert IMG_1001.JPG and there is one already in the extracted photos folder. You may be changing it to be secondIMG_1001.JPG. So the program will copy it. Additionally you can add os.path.exists functionality while copying if you believe it will help you.

If you think this was useful you can get me a coffee by sending it through my paypal account: paypal.me/blxyon

Comments are just for my debugging purposes.
