It worked for my ios 13.4.1 iPhone and I bet it will work for other versions too.

Unfortunately this software is limited to the photos and videos!
I am happy to help you by email: blxyon@yahoo.com to extract any of your data from an unecrypted iPhone/iPad backup.
I am quick with my emails so do not worry.

If you think this was useful you can get me a coffee by sending it through my paypal account: blxyon@yahoo.com

Comments are just for my debugging purposes.
